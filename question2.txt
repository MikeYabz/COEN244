To keep track of rentals and their return dates, modify the CarRental class to include these fields:
- Date rentalDate
- int duration

By looping through the CarRental objects and comparing today's date with (rentalDate + duration days), we could check if the rental is close to expiring or has expired, and take action.

This also lets the company keep track of previous rentals, while allowing it to schedule future rentals.
